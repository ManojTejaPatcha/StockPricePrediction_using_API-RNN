# 🤑 Stock Price Prediction using API & RNN 🎉

Welcome to the rollercoaster ride of stock price prediction! Buckle up as we dive into the magical world of RNNs and APIs to foresee the unpredictable market moves. 🚀

## 📈 Project Overview

Ever wished you had a crystal ball for the stock market? Well, we’ve got something better – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks! This project uses historical stock price data to predict future prices, making you feel like a financial wizard. 🧙‍♂️

## 🔧 Tech Arsenal

- **Python**: The Swiss Army knife of programming languages.
- **yfinance**: Our spy to fetch top-secret stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Matplotlib & mplfinance**: Turning boring numbers into beautiful visual stories.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: The dynamic duo for data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: Scaling heights (and stock prices) with MinMaxScaler.
- **Keras**: Crafting our LSTM with a TensorFlow backend because we mean business.

## 🎯 Features

1. **Data Fetching**: Like a ninja, we grab historical stock data using yfinance.
2. **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and mplfinance help us visualize data like a Wall Street artist.
3. **Data Preparation**: We groom our data, scaling it to perfection.
4. **LSTM Model Building**: Constructing our prediction beast with Keras.
5. **Testing & Prediction**: The moment of truth – making predictions and seeing the future!
6. **Results Visualization**: Showcasing our predictions versus actual prices because who doesn’t love graphs?

## 📜 Workflow

1. **Fetch Data**: Choose your stock and date range.
2. **Visualize**: Plot it like it's hot.
3. **Prepare Data**: Scale and sequence like a pro.
4. **Build & Train Model**: Unleash the LSTM power.
5. **Predict & Evaluate**: Predict the future and pat yourself on the back.

## 🎉 Conclusion

Voilà! You now have a time machine for stock prices. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use your newfound skills wisely, and may your investments always be in the green! 🌿
